# Automated Air Void Analysis System for Hardened Concrete

## Introduction
This project was developed as my final university project at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS). It introduces an automated system designed to enhance the ASTM C457 air void analysis test in hardened concrete. The automation of this test reduces human intervention, minimizes potential errors, lowers operational costs, and increases both efficiency and accuracy of air void measurements in concrete structures.

## Project Objectives
- **Automate the ASTM C457 test** to improve accuracy and efficiency in air void analysis.
- **Streamline processes** to reduce the manual labor traditionally required.
- **Enhance data reliability** by minimizing human error through automation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Utilized for developing the automation software, with libraries such as OpenCV for image processing.
- **3D Printing Technology**: Employed to modify and use a 3D printer chassis as a precision mechanism for sample maneuvering under a microscope.
- **Image Processing Algorithms**: Includes stitching algorithms and deep learning models for accurate image analysis.

## Features
- **Detailed Image Acquisition**: Uses a digital microscope mounted on a modified 3D printer framework to capture high-resolution images of concrete samples.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Implements image stitching to composite multiple images into a single, detailed image for analysis.
- **Robust Analysis Algorithms**: Utilizes machine learning models for segmenting and analyzing the air void structure effectively.
